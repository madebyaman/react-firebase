# What did I learn?

- Catching errors can be done through component.
- I should follow feature based organization. And export everything in index.js file.
- Common ui elements can be exported in a separate folder.
- To avoid vendor lock-in, I should use wrapper function and return only relevant values.
- In book notes app, I had put all the sign in related functions in context. Instead, I should have exported them as a regular functions.
